# Python-Tkinter-Website-Opener
A basic project I did, when learning python's Tkinter library. Application allows user to click a button and opens a url to the specified button's link. 

The setup.py build can also be found within the apps folders. 
Application is built to run on windows, but will also be executable on Mac's OS if ran as a python script.
